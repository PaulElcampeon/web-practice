            <h1 class="underline blackText bold">About</h1>
            <p>Schizophrenia is a debilitating illness that affects approximately 1 percent of the population and only a
                quarter of sufferers overcome the illness enough to become functional members of society.</p>
            <p>I have started this website to better that statistic, having had the illness myself for over 10 years. I
                have
                decided to share what has helped me to put myself in that quarter of sufferers and hopefully help others
                out
                of the illness as well. I am not all the way perfect yet, but well on the way.</p>

                    <p class="bold">2009</p>
                    <p class="line-spacing-extra">This was the year I was first sectioned. Things had not been right with myself for a long time. I
                        had
                        A-Level exams to complete before going to University. I think it was in the middle of
                        examination
                        season that things started to go wrong. Very wrong. I was doing four subjects and was booked in
                        for
                        19 exams. I was told I could pick and choose which ones I go for. I was under immense pressure
                        and
                        was extremely overwhelmed. When I was on the commute to college I would be seeing ordinary
                        people
                        but believe I could see something extra in them. Something evil and sinister. I became very
                        paranoid
                        every time I left the house. The delusions increased and took on a more religious themed
                        narrative.
                        I thought everyone was in on it. My behaviour became extremely erratic and unusual at home to
                        the
                        point where my parents became very concerned. I ended up getting sectioned for three months and
                        spent the entirety of summer in hospital.</p>

                    <p class="bold">Why I am writing a blog</p>
                    <p class="line-spacing-extra">The premise of my website is to help other people out of this illness. Being ill in this way has
                        caused me so much pain and heartache over the years. It is probably one of the worst things a
                        young
                        person can experience. When I left hospital in 2009, I lost all my motivation and drive, I
                        didn't
                        have my bath everyday and I did not have the impetus to do anything. I have come a very long way
                        since then. I have completed a University degree and now have a job in education. The job seems
                        to
                        be going well at the moment. About 3 years ago I found a few good habits that have helped me to
                        make
                        this possible. These habits are included on my website. I am writing this blog to tell the rest
                        of
                        my story which I hope can encourage and inspire others in the same situation. Be on the look out
                        for
                        future posts:)</p>
